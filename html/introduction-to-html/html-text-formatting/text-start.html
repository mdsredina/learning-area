    This simple Acai Bowl recipe only uses three ingredients! It’s easy to make and absolutely delicious. You can customize your acai bowl by loading it up with your favorite toppings.

    What is acai? The acai berry (pronounced ah-sigh-ee) is a small (about an inch long) deep purple fruit. It comes from the acai palm tree, which is native to Central and South America.

    <h2>3 ingredients for your acai bowl:</h2>

    <ol><li><strong>Unsweetened Acai:</strong> I recommend breaking up the frozen acai packet for easier blending </li>
   <li><strong>Frozen Banana:</strong> this adds natural sweetness and makes the mixture super creamy! </li>
    <li><strong>Vegan Milk or Yogurt of your choice:</strong> this makes the mixture blend easily and creates creaminess. I love using non-dairy milk to help it blend up, and coconut water and juices also work. If you want to use yogurt but it’s thick, you’ll likely need to add a liquid as well to help it blend smoothly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What are the best acai bowl toppings?</h2>
I love topping my bowl with berries, granola, and flaked coconut, and a thick drizzle of peanut butter or almond butter! You can also use hemp seeds, flax seeds, or chia seeds for extra nutritional boosts.
